Once finished, demonstrate the functionality of the design to the teacher, then commit the design files (*) to git.

(*) The required files are vhdl-sources (.vhd), constrained file (.xdc) and the project file (.xpr). If you have performed simulations, you might want to add simulator configuration file (.wcfg) as well.
